Internet addiction is a real thing, folks. Unfortunately ~~or fortunately if you ask a younger me~~, it isn't taken very seriously.  Skip my rambling and go straight to the [[#The Facts]].

### I hate to admit this.

I hate to admit this, I really do. I jokingly call myself "Internet's adopted child" because of how the Internet was my home and my escape, and how it still is. I'll be the first one to defend the Internet, defend the myriad uses, and first one to criticize "salty boomers" whose claims are substantiated with zero evidence and only backed by the dreaded *"back in my days"*. 

The Internet is great. I have an entire website dedicated to how amazing the Internet is. I'm an archivist and a wannabe Internet Historian. The annals of Internet history and culture never ceases to amaze me.
