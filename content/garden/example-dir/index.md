## Welcome to Romblings! ðŸŒ±

A hodge-podge of a digital garden[^digitalgarden], a codex vitae[^codex], a blog, and a wiki.  It's 
somewhat the sum of all my knowledge. Constantly evolving, changing, and morphing. 

This contains (or will contain) a lot of resources, my thoughts and opinion on a lot of things, some reflections, about [[Philosophies|philosophies]] that have really changed my life, and maybe some rants too. 

You'll find writings of all kinds here; Psychology, Epistemology, Politics, Tech, and everything under the sun.  You will also find a lot of broken links and dead-ends or stub articles. It's a work in progress. 

I will try my hardest to make a clear demarcation between my beliefs and opinions, and facts by stating what is what. If the page has a tag that says "blog", it is mostly my opinions and beliefs. On pages that are based on established concepts, I might have a section called "My Take" which contains my opinions, which can range from incohenrent and irreverent to hopefully, insightful.  

 If I do slip up, let me know. Transparency is one of my core tenets, and I'll strive hard to do justice to it. But please remember that this is the Internet after all, and take everything with a grain of salt. Some things here might not apply to you, might be wrong, or straight up silly. I'd love to hear your opinions, though! Leave a message on the chatbox on my site. I'm also adding more ways to contact me, and a discussion page for Romblings. 


### What is a [[digital gardens|digital garden]]? ðŸŒ¸



### Why?
- Everything is linked; to find links between seemingly unrelated things - even if the links are meaningless and are a result of correlation and nothing more
- A personal wiki for me. You know how you want to pull up a particular study, or a particular statistic, or something else to win an argument but good ole tip-of-the-tongue syndrome hits? No? Just me? Okay. . . 
- To preserve knowledge and archive things interesting to me
- To reflect and ponder, to welcome change instead of resist it. To revisit concepts and re-examine my views. 
- To make sure it's available to everyone 
- [[Zettelkasten Method]] (heavily inspired, loosely implemented)
- To find how many times I refer to a topic, concept or even a phrase!
