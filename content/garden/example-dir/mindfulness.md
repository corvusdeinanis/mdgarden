"All of this contributes to healthier digestion. Over time, this practice—even if you only engage in it occasionally—can help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier." 

**Mini-Mindfulness Practices**

Although multitasking may be unavoidable at times, the daily experience of pressure to “get things done” unconsciously ensnares many people in its gravitational pull. Multitasking frequently becomes standard operating procedure, even when it isn’t necessary.

1.  Strive to minimize multitasking and do one thing at a time; be present with the task at hand, giving it your undiluted [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention "Psychology Today looks at attention").
2.  Do it deliberately and without rushing—even (and perhaps especially) if you feel pressure—external or internal—to do so. As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, regularly instructed his players, “Be quick, but don’t hurry.”
3.  Do it to completion.
4.  space—even a brief pause—between the activities in which you engage rather than going directly from one task to the next.
5.  yourself permission to do less than what you may have planned or what your thinking says you “should do” or “have to do.”
6.  Each time you scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media platforms, pause on a random name (be it someone you know or not) and take a moment to wish that person well—perhaps literally saying to yourself: __________, may you be well. May you be at peace.
7.  As you wake up from sleep, take a moment while [lying](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception "Psychology Today looks at lying") in bed with your eyes open and express appreciation for the gift of waking up to another day. Not everyone receives this gift.
8.  When you first step outside in the morning, take a few seconds to observe—without judgment—the sights and sounds of your neighborhood.
9.  When you approach a window in your home or office, take a few moments to pause, look through it, and really notice what you see.

**Mindful Eating**

Many people, both in and out of recovery, eat emotionally—that is, they eat in response to stress or emotional discomfort ([anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety "Psychology Today looks at anxiety"), [fear](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear "Psychology Today looks at fear"), [loneliness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/loneliness "Psychology Today looks at loneliness"), [boredom](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/boredom "Psychology Today looks at boredom"), [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger "Psychology Today looks at anger"), or sadness). Sometimes, this is also an attempt to fill a sense of internal emptiness. When people behave this way, they eat without thinking about what or why they’re eating; they may not even taste the food, which they chew quickly and incompletely. Have you ever finished eating something only to realize you don’t know how it tasted?

Mindful eating is the antithesis of [stressed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress "Psychology Today looks at stressed") or [emotional eating](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/appetite "Psychology Today looks at emotional eating") and the antidote for it. Mindful eating means paying conscious attention to the experience of eating using all the senses. It emphasizes the awareness of taste, as well as colors, textures, smells, and sounds, during the process of eating. For instance, when mindfully eating an apple, you might notice the color, feel how smooth it is, take in its fragrance, listen to what it sounds like when you bite into it, and taste it fully, one bite at a time.

1.  Before you eat, bring your awareness to the activity. Are you actually hungry and need nourishment in preparation for some activity, or are you eating out of some sort of emotional dis-ease?
2.  As much as possible, try to eat before you get to the point of being extremely hungry.
3.  Take two or three deep breaths to relax and connect your mind with your body.
4.  Appreciate the food you’re getting ready to eat.
5.  Consider what it took to get that food from its origins to your table.
6.  As you eat, notice the aroma(s), texture(s), and color(s) of your food.
7.  Take one bite at a time, tasting it fully.
8.  Chew your food carefully, savoring it.
9.  Swallow it slowly.
10.  Wait until you’ve completely swallowed one bite of your food before taking the next one.
11.  Pause briefly and take an intentional breath—in and out—between swallowing and taking that next bite.
12.  As you eat, remind yourself to breathe.
13.  Pay attention to when you feel satisfied or beginto feel “full.”
14.  Stop eating when you reach this point, rather than continuing to eat until you feel “stuffed” and uncomfortable.
15.  If there is food left, store it for another time.
16.  Notice how you feel when you are finished eating.

By making the experience of taking food and drink into the body much more conscious, eating mindfully slows the process of ingesting, tasting, chewing, and swallowing. The intent is to pay close and careful attention to the sensory aspects of your food and the process of eating and to eat deliberately rather than unconsciously shoveling food into your face. The result is that you will eat more slowly, taste your food more thoroughly, chew your food more completely, and swallow it more patiently.

All of this contributes to healthier digestion. Over time, this practice—even if you only engage in it occasionally—can help you change your relationship with food to one that is more present-centered, satisfying, and healthier.

Mindfulness is a state of active, open [attention](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/attention "Psychology Today looks at attention") to the present. This state is described as observing one’s thoughts and feelings without judging them as good or bad.

The emergence of mindfulness in Western culture can be attributed to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn studied mindfulness under several Buddhist teachers, such as Philip Kapleau and Thich Nhat Hanh. As a professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn developed a program called Mindfulness-Based [Stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/stress "Psychology Today looks at Stress") Reduction (MBSR) to treat [chronic pain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/chronic-pain "Psychology Today looks at chronic pain"). He discovered that patients would often try to avoid pain—but that that avoidance would lead to deeper distress. Practicing mindfulness was a more successful approach.

### What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness encompasses two key ingredients: [awareness and acceptance.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201502/what-is-mindfulness-and-how-does-it-work)

Spradlin (2003) adapts DBT’s “what” skills of mindfulness to help us begin the journey of practicing mindful awareness: 
### **Observe:**

-   Start to simply _notice_ your environment, thoughts, feelings, and sensations without _reacting_ to them
-   Observe the emotion you are feeling or the thought you are having
-   Simply see it there before you, without adding anything to it, judging it, or trying to change it
-   Avoid reacting to your emotions – say to yourself,”I notice that I feel love/anger/joy”
-   Allow your thoughts, feelings, and sensations to come and go (as they all _do_) – control your _attention_, not _what_ you see
-   Push nothing away (no matter how uncomfortable/painful) and cling to nothing (no matter how enjoyable/pleasant)
-   Be _alert_ to all that enters your experience – every thought, feeling, and sensation
-   Pay close attention to the input you receive from all 5 senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste

### **Describe:**

-   Now that you have observed, use _words_ to practice describing your internal experience
-   Stay descriptive and simple
-   If you have been taught to ignore/belittle emotions, it can be difficult to be attentive and mindful to your experience
-   If you have difficulty, or if this feels unnatural, simply say to yourself, “I notice that I’m feeling self-conscious right now”
-   If you’re feeling frustrated or anxious, say to yourself, “I notice how my thoughts are coming very quickly right now”

### **Participate:**

-   With practice, mindfulness will allow you to more fully _participate_ in your own life and experiences
-   Mindfulness will allow you to _fully engage_ in every experience without needing to “love” or “hate” it
-   Practice simply participating in each moment as it comes – _be here now_
-   If you need to make plans for the future, then _fully participate_ in making those plans
-   Allow yourself to be a part of what is happening without obsessing over every detail or becoming self-conscious
-   Practice _letting go_ of thoughts like “How am I doing?” or “How do I look?”
