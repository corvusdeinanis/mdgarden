Automatic thoughts...  
 Can be words, an image, a memory, a physical sensation, an imagined sound,  
or based on ‘intuition’ – a sense of just ‘knowing’  
 Believable – we tend to automatically believe our thoughts, usually not  
stopping to question their validity. When another driver cuts me up, I might  
judge that he’s a selfish thoughtless toad, but in fact, he might be taking his  
wife to hospital as she’s about to give birth. Thoughts are not necessarily  
true, accurate or helpful. Often based on emotion (rather than facts), which  
drives our opinion. Don’t believe everything you think!  
 Are automatic. They just happen, popping into your head and you often won’t  
even notice them.  
 Our thoughts are ours – they can be quite specific to us, perhaps because of  
our present or past experience, knowledge, values and culture, or just for no  
good reason at all. Some thoughts are so out of keeping with all those things,  
and that can make them seem all the more distressing – because we add  
some meaning about why we had them (I must be a bad person!)  
 Habitual and persistent – our thoughts seem to repeat over and over, and the  
more they repeat, the more believable they seem, then they set off a whole  
chain of new related thoughts that lead us to feel worse and worse. They can  
follow themes, for short periods, or very often, throughout years and decades.
